# Heart-Attack-Prediction-using-Python
Performed a classification on provided dataset of Heart Attack prediction. For that prediction, first of all preprocessed dataset and convert it into appropriate numeric form. Then perform  Machine Learning model for the prediction of Label. Here are some outcomes of the project 
1) Preprocessing
2) Applied Machine Learning algorithms for the prediction and apply majority voting concept for the final output. Majority voting means to take Predicted labels from all applied classifiers and assign final label according to majority vote.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis: Lot of graphs to understand the Data insights.
4) Good Accuracy, F Score
